# The bots' workbench

A bot works on this computer with a shell, a real browser and the sign-ins the user chooses to lend
it, in a workspace the app lays out and clears by age.

## Start here
- `features/workspace/workspace.ts` — the workspace folders, `writeRefusal`, `insideWorkspace`, each shell's environment, fetching the browser, closing and forgetting a thread's browsers.
- `lib/sandbox.ts` — the shell: scrubbed environment, timeouts that kill the process group, long output folded to a file.
- `features/ai/tools/workspace.tool.ts` — `bash`, `write_file`, and the shell guide on a bot's first command.
- `features/signins/signins.query.ts` — the sign-in vault: keep, borrow, renew, whose browser a session drives.
- `features/ai/tools/signin.tool.ts` — `sign_in_use` and `sign_in_keep`.
- `features/signins/components/signins-setting.tsx` — Settings › Sign-ins: which bots may borrow, and signing out.
- `skills/browser/SKILL.md` — what a bot is told about the browser.

## How it fits
Every shell opens through `openWorkspace` onto `lib/sandbox`, whose every command and write tells
an open file to look again (the `files` signal); for a bot, `features/ai/load-tools.ts`
lays `jobShellEnv` and `botShellEnv` over each command and hands the same session to the deck and
sign-in tools. The sandbox is a working directory and a scrubbed environment, not isolation: `bash`
reaches the whole disk as the user, and `writeRefusal` fences `write_file` alone.
`features/bot/bot.runner.ts` calls the closing functions here on cancel and delete and in
`sweepJobFiles`, which boot and a timer run; `features/bot/bot.run.ts` renews kept sign-ins after
every turn. A bot refused a sign-in it did not keep lands on that sign-in's `asking` list, and only
Settings › Sign-ins or `signin-ask.tsx` in its question lets it in.

## What breaks
- A command a bot's tools send the browser CLI without that participant's `jobShellEnv`
  (`botBrowserSession`: one job, one participant) lands in the shared `default` session no cancel
  closes, and a session keyed to the bot alone lets one job's `open` close another's browser.
- Cancel, delete and the sweep find a thread's browsers and profiles by its session prefix: a
  second browser a job opens under a name other than `<its session>-<suffix>` (as `inPageApart` in
  `skills/browser/scripts/session.mjs` names one) is never found.
- A variable the app sets to run itself (`bin/thursday.mjs`, a server it starts) that `APP_OWN` in
  `lib/sandbox.ts` does not match is read by every bot's project as its own: Thursday's port,
  production mode, Next's config.
- Every shell can read the sign-in vault, so the tools are its lock: a kept sign-in is replaced
  only by a bot on its list and renewed only from a browser the app lent it to (`keepSignIn`,
  `holdSignIn`).
- This area leans on `@playwright/cli`'s variable names, `list --json`, the `.playwright` marker
  and how it names its daemon folder, where a change fails quietly as windows left open and
  profiles piling up. It is pinned to one version in `package.json`, which each install of the
  published package resolves itself (`scripts/pack.mts`), and moves only after the browser check
  below, then `pnpm install --lockfile-only`.

## Check
`pnpm test:bot` runs bots' shells against a stand-in `playwright-cli`, so it proves nothing about the
real browser or a sign-in. To see them, on a scratch app (AGENTS.md › Running the app; its command
skips the browser download, so the browser must already be in Playwright's cache) have a bot open a
page `--headed`: cancelling the job closes the window and keeps its profile in the CLI's daemon
folder (`browserDataFolder` says where; `open --persistent` without `--headed` keeps one with no
window), and deleting the job then removes the thread's entries
there. A sign-in kept there lands in the scratch home's `.sign-ins`. `playwright-cli attach` drives
the real Chrome of whoever runs it, scratch app or not.
