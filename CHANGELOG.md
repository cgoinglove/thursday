* **seeds:** a board's spec is the design, not the frame around it ([9cf203c](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/9cf203cc8f728bfd87799216820fb169ee0d61ba))
* **seeds:** the Instagram skill says the sign-in order too ([d64726c](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/d64726cdbe6947994925f719cc318728cf01dbe8))
* **signins:** a refused sign-in goes to the user's own Chrome, and the order is said right ([75f7ba6](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/75f7ba6f297a92c56dcfa169925e5d8ed1378f68))
* **skills:** a board keeps its list indent and inline icons; the shooters find the shipped skills beside them ([a5a1a57](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/a5a1a5704e77484ede96c9c04b3dee061483c24d))
* **skills:** a board that sets its own height cannot hide what overflows it ([57304e3](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/57304e3cc936f4b0b4ba0555769793775a79d7c2))

* **skills:** a skill switched off stays off in the user's config, not in its files ([bf62590](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/bf625907aee63a6a02d22c2f298c466d5d48a451))

* **ui:** Esc goes to the last thing opened, and the foot of the screen is one column ([2e22e13](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/2e22e13eb43ac909927e4b7e8a0ef69cd624a758))
* **ui:** Korean inside a mono label is Noto Sans KR, not the OS font ([13115cc](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/13115ccd87baf4356fe4105fc23f0e2dd01b11c4))
* **ui:** one message box at a time, and the room has the foot ([e75bc2e](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/e75bc2e0d831247b71c80581a8486892112690e9))

* **ui:** the effort's Auto presses rather than slides ([cc8c16e](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/cc8c16e5c128c43d1cedbb246f0ea5cd9689c9d0))
* **ui:** the pill is furniture, so it holds its corner when the line comes up ([f9b48e1](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/f9b48e1f040c8fd225fe4ea83de7beceb92086da))

* **workspace:** a file nothing here draws opens in its own program, and Reveal shows it in its folder ([f54927f](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/f54927f2adef9f3d08b6b01452a2c68e2710f26d))
* **workspace:** a one-slash scheme is a link prefix, not part of the path ([814921d](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/814921dfb6d18681594bd7bcb623aeaa6470ea72))
* **workspace:** a page opened on its own takes the keyboard, so a deck turns on the first arrow ([8869b73](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/8869b73c47005435f33a79385e769fd0955c32d6))

* **workspace:** two saves of one page never share a file beside it ([ee3ddb1](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/ee3ddb13537f6ebb879002f6a0bef9ae5d2140a3))


### Performance

* **ui:** a file's face is optimized to its tile, and a report's pictures wait ([2534ab8](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday/commit/2534ab8a7f4877fa42715d2a2b3a42cce743bc9e))
