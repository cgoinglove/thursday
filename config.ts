 * - `rateRetries`  how many times one request waits out a service's "too many requests"
 *   before its refusal stands. Higher rides out a longer burst; lower gives up on a long
 *   answer's last pieces sooner.
 * - `rateWaitMs`  the longest one such wait. A service asking for more is refused rather than
 *   waited on: a turn that waits holds up everything written after it.
 * - `codeDigits`  how long the code is that someone asking to be let in is sent, and the

 * - `pictures`  how many pictures of a page go with it (reach/pictures): its first slides or
 *   boards, or its first screens from the top. With the page itself that is ten files, what
 *   one Discord message carries and one Telegram album holds; the page has the rest.
 * - `drawMs`  how long drawing them may take before the page goes without them. Nine slides
 *   draw in a few seconds; a page that never finishes loading would otherwise hold up
 *   everything sent after it.
 * - `lookMs`  how long a change to the threads waits before open work is looked for, so the
